## Preliminary

## Requirements

Different stages of PROTACable pipeline have variable set of requirements.
### Conda environment:
* See [Installation](#installation) below.
### Linux OS:
* This toolkit collection had been tested on Centos 8 OS.
* SLURM scheduler is needed for Stage 2 (protein-protein docking) due to the way the code was implemented.
### Software:
* Stage 1: GNINA v1.0 (optional).
* Stage 2: ProPOSE v2022.
* Stage 5: Maestro SchrÃ¶dinger (Preferred to have).
### Hardware:
* CUDA >= 11.0 (optional)


## Installation

To get started with PROTACable, follow these instructions:

```
git clone https://github.com/giaguaro/PROTACable.git 
cd PROTACable
export PROTACable=${pwd}
```
> **Note:** You need to have the environment variable defined at all times during running any part of the code.

### Conda environment:

```
conda env create -f PROTACable.yml
```
> **Note:** This may look like a complicated environment (and it is). It is important to take note of the most important packages and build the environment gradually in case making the environemnt proves intractable for certain cases. Although it could be an unconventional approach, you may want to create an additional environment where conflicting packages are installed and then move those packages back to the PROTACable environment packages directory.
> [Follow NVIDIA's instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/#axzz4TWipdwX1) to install the latest version of CUDA (>= 11.0 is required). Make sure `nvcc` is in your PATH.

### Software:

- **GNINA**: Please refer to GNINA official repository - https://github.com/gnina/gnina
  
Once GNINA is installed place it in the ```PROTACable_stage_1/utilities``` directory.
 
- **ProPOSE**: Please refer to ProPOSE official website for academic licensing - https://mm.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ccbpub/propose_main.php

Once ProPOSE software and license is obtained place them in the ```PROTACable_stage_2/ProPOSE``` directory.

*Preferred*

- **Maestro**: Please refer to Maestro official website for download and tokens - https://www.schrodinger.com/products/maestro

Only Maestro's PrepWizard will be used and will be used only in Stage 5. This tool will serve the purpose of minimization of the selected ternary complexes modelled throughout the pipeline. 


(Note: Remove the extra backticks around the code blocks above.)

## Usage

Due to the complexity of the pipeline, each stage was kept operating separately such that there is a finer control over the results before the subsequent stage is activated. 



\```
from project_title import AwesomeFeature

# Initialize
feature = AwesomeFeature()

# Use the feature
result = feature.do_something_cool()
print(result)
\```

(Note: Remove the extra backticks around the code blocks above.)
