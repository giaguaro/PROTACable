## Preliminary

## Requirements

Different stages of PROTACable pipeline have variable set of requirements.
### Conda environment:
* See [Installation](#installation) below.
### Linux OS:
* This toolkit collection had been tested on Centos 8 OS.
* SLURM scheduler is needed for Stage 2 (protein-protein docking) due to the way the code was implemented.
### Software:
* Stage 1: GNINA v1.0 (optional).
* Stage 2: ProPOSE v2022.
* Stage 5: Maestro Schrödinger (optional).
### Hardware:
* CUDA >= 11.0 (optional)


## Installation

To get started with PROTACable, follow these instructions:

```
git clone https://github.com/giaguaro/PROTACable.git 
cd PROTACable
export PROTACable=${pwd}
```

### Conda environment:

```
conda env create -f PROTACable.yml
```
> **Note:** This may look like a complicated environment (and it is). It is important to take note of the most important packages and build the environment gradually. Although unconventional, you may want to create an additional environment where intractable packages are installed and then move those packages back to the PROTACable environment packages directory.
> [Follow NVIDIA's instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/#axzz4TWipdwX1) to install the latest version of CUDA (>= 11.0 is required). Make sure `nvcc` is in your PATH.

### Software:

- **GNINA**: Please refer to GNINA official repository - https://github.com/gnina/gnina
  
Once GNINA is installed place it in the ```PROTACable_stage_1/utilities``` directory.
 
- **ProPOSE**: Please refer to ProPOSE official website for academic licensing - https://mm.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ccbpub/propose_main.php

Once ProPOSE software and license is obtained place them in the ```PROTACable_stage_2/ProPOSE``` directory.

*Optional*

- **Maestro**: Please refer to Maestro official website for download and tokens - https://www.schrodinger.com/products/maestro

Only Maestro's PrepWizard will be used f
